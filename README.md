# Prism-Menu
A mod menu made in Geode for Geometry Dash

# TODOs (Based on whats next)
- Fix bug with uncomplete level where it causes buttons to stop working
- Fix "Uncomplete Level" not working in Gauntlets
- Add Noclip Accuracy Flash (flashes screen red when hitting)
- Add translations for "Uncomplete Level"
- Add a "First Start" menu when you install prism for the first time (Like, ask what language, theme, etc). Only do this when the user clicks on the prism button, and not show again after doing it unless they reset defaults.
- Add instant respawn
- Add credits screen for cocos2d ui
- Add a "Font Downloader" for languages like Japanese, Chinese, Arabic, etc
- Added Japanese Translations. (bruh 1000 characters :( actually 280 chars)
- Add Arabic translations (this ones gonna be hard)
- Added accents to Vietnamese Translations.
- Add a "Replay Bot" (LBot, named after Lartum ig? or Fluorite, Acrylic, or idk if theres a better name because i didnt come up with this, im bad at naming)
- get fps bypass working on mac os
- Allow changing the prism button icon (different colors, up to the server icon style)
- Add a toggle to "Lock 2.21 icons"
- Add "Transparent Lists" (look in https://discord.com/channels/911701438269386882/911702353546215524/1205501190025117779)
- Change button icon to be the same as server icon
- Add ???
- Add to Misc category everything related to changing "Stats", basically allows you to edit your stats like mana, diamonds, etc. NOT ADDING STARS, DEMONS, AND OTHER FOR REASONS.
- Add background-image for custom themes (note for me: look in https://discord.com/channels/@me/1156358012852776992/1172693426429505546)
- Allow for dragging the button
- Add menu scale for the cocos ui
- Add "Custom Object Bypass" (basically allows you to store more than 1000 objects in custom object)
- (Possibly?) Fix FPS Bypass, or add "Show FPS" for Android users. (RE iads mod menu or something to see how it works, im HOPING its not an adb command because that doesnt work well)
- Refactor the "patching" part to allow more mods (TPS bypass) by separating for platforms ("Windows", "Mac OS", "Android", "iOS")
- Allow for resizing the menu with a minimum size and maximum size (Only imgui)
- Add animated background support (Custom theme only unless I add a theme that supports it)
- Port doggos mod (Startpos Switcher) to be supported for Android & Mac. IF HE DOESNT ACCEPT, I WILL PROCEED TO MAKE IT ON PRISM
- Add a way to customize keybinds
- Add "Randomize Gamemode" just for fun
- Allow themes to be imported via zip files (for fonts) or json files
- Add a "Custom Themes Marketplace" (use aws or idk what server)
- Allow button icon to be customizable based on theme.
- Allow users to upload their macros for other users to use (If I decide to make Replay Bot on this mod, same story with another mod if i end up making it as another mod)
- maybe switch to ArianaPro-Regular font? looks nice imo. make a font switcher
- Add "Coin Finder" (look at https://discord.com/channels/1199008625683869787/1199008626451423275/1201272567244275903)

# a note for a certain somebody
please credit me and ask before using my code, and **make sure it's open sourced**. I worked hard on this project and I don't want some of the features to have its code taken without me knowing.

anyways will do README later, possibly instructions and such.
