# Prism-Menu
A mod menu made in Geode for Geometry Dash

# TODOs (Based on whats next)
- Add a keyback function for those that use keyback on android
- Fix bug with the menu buttons not working 
    STEPS:

- Fix bug with input button not working for button position on android
- Add credits screen for cocos2d ui
- Allow for dragging the button
- Add "Render Hitbox" (Basically enables hitbox even if not in practice mode)
- Add menu scale for the cocos ui
- Add "Transparent Lists" (look in https://discord.com/channels/911701438269386882/911702353546215524/1205501190025117779)
- Add "No Shaders"
- Add "uncomplete level" hack
- Add "Custom Object Bypass" (basically allows you to store more than 1000 objects in custom object)
- Add "Show Hitboxes"
- Add "Show Hitbox on Death" & "Hitbox Trail"
- Add background-image for custom themes (note for me: look in https://discord.com/channels/@me/1156358012852776992/1172693426429505546)
- Add "No Camera Movement" (basically removes all 2.2 camera stuff and only aims the camera at the player)
- Add to Misc category everything related to changing "Stats", basically allows you to edit your stats like mana, diamonds, etc. NOT ADDING STARS, DEMONS, AND OTHER FOR REASONS.
- (Possibly?) Fix FPS Bypass, or add "Show FPS" for Android users. (The func exists, just not visible to the end user lol)
- Allow for resizing the menu with a minimum size and maximum size (Only imgui)
- Add animated background support (Custom theme only unless I add a theme that supports it)
- Add startpos switcher
- Add a way to customize keybinds
- Add a "Replay Bot" (Might turn this into another mod instead)
- Add "Randomize Gamemode" just for fun
- Add a "Custom Themes Marketplace" (use aws or idk what server)
- Allow users to upload their macros for other users to use (If I decide to make Replay Bot on this mod, same story with another mod if i end up making it as another mod)
- maybe switch to ArianaPro-Regular font? looks nice imo. make a font switcher
- Add "Coin Finder" (look at https://discord.com/channels/1199008625683869787/1199008626451423275/1201272567244275903)


Will do README later.
