# Prism-Menu
A mod menu made in Geode for Geometry Dash

# TODOs (Based on whats next)
- Added Vietnamese Translations.
- Add "uncomplete level" hack
- Add a "First Start" menu when you install prism for the first time (Like, ask what language, theme, etc). Only do this when the user clicks on the prism button, and not show again after doing it unless they reset defaults.
- Fix bug with input button not working for button position on android (ok why cant i reproduce this now wth)
- Add a "Font Downloader" for languages like Japanese, Chinese, Arabic, etc
- Added Japanese Translations. (bruh 1000 characters :()
- Add Arabic translations (this ones gonna be hard)
- Add credits screen for cocos2d ui
- Allow changing the prism button icon (different colors, up to the server icon style)
- Add a toggle to "Lock 2.21 icons"
- Add "Transparent Lists" (look in https://discord.com/channels/911701438269386882/911702353546215524/1205501190025117779)
- Change button icon to be the same as server icon
- Add ???
- Add to Misc category everything related to changing "Stats", basically allows you to edit your stats like mana, diamonds, etc. NOT ADDING STARS, DEMONS, AND OTHER FOR REASONS.
- Add background-image for custom themes (note for me: look in https://discord.com/channels/@me/1156358012852776992/1172693426429505546)
- Allow for dragging the button
- Add "No Camera Movement" (basically removes all 2.2 camera stuff and only aims the camera at the player)
- Add menu scale for the cocos ui
- Add "Custom Object Bypass" (basically allows you to store more than 1000 objects in custom object)
- (Possibly?) Fix FPS Bypass, or add "Show FPS" for Android users. (The func exists, just not visible to the end user lol)
- Allow for resizing the menu with a minimum size and maximum size (Only imgui)
- Add animated background support (Custom theme only unless I add a theme that supports it)
- Add startpos switcher (might not be needed anymore? theres literally a mod for it)
- Add a way to customize keybinds
- Add a "Replay Bot" (Might turn this into another mod instead)
- Add "Randomize Gamemode" just for fun
- Allow themes to be imported via zip files (for fonts) or json files
- Add a "Custom Themes Marketplace" (use aws or idk what server)
- Allow button icon to be customizable based on theme.
- Allow users to upload their macros for other users to use (If I decide to make Replay Bot on this mod, same story with another mod if i end up making it as another mod)
- maybe switch to ArianaPro-Regular font? looks nice imo. make a font switcher
- Add "Coin Finder" (look at https://discord.com/channels/1199008625683869787/1199008626451423275/1201272567244275903)
