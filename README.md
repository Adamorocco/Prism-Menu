# Prism-Menu
A mod menu made in Geode for Geometry Dash

# TODOs (Based on whats next)
- Create another UI (cocos2d) option for mobile users
- Add credits screen for cocos2d ui
- Allow for dragging the button
- Add "Render Hitbox" (Basically enables hitbox even if not in practice mode)
- Add "Disable Shaders"
- Add "No Camera Movement" (basically removes all 2.2 camera stuff and only aims the camera at the player)
- Add to Misc category everything related to changing "Stats", basically allows you to edit your stats like mana, diamonds, etc. NOT ADDING STARS, DEMONS, AND OTHER FOR REASONS.
- (Possibly?) Fix FPS Bypass, or add "Show FPS" for Android users. (The func exists, just not visible to the end user lol)
- Allow for resizing the menu with a minimum size and maximum size (Only imgui)
- Add light theme
- Add startpos switcher
- Add "uncomplete level" hack
- Add a "Replay Bot"
- Add "Hitbox on Death" & "Hitbox Trail"
- Add "Randomize Gamemode" just for fun

Will do README later.
